# Hello world - setup.py version

Here's a hello world with setup.py

## How this works

There's a folder called "hello_world" that contains the package we are installing with our setup.py file.

The directory our package's files reside in is specified in the `setup` function here:

```python
      packages=['hello_world'],
```
